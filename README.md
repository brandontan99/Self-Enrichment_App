<br />

<br />
Almost Done:<br />
Setting (dark theme, notification)<br />
EditProfile (still stuck at profile picture, can upload to storage but cannot create a field in firestore)<br />
Google sign in (thinking just drop it since we already have custom login and registration)<br />
<br />
Just have a page:<br />
Dashboard<br />

At least the flow has no problem (for demo), can't guarantee for stress test)
