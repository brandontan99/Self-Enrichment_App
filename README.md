# Self-Enrichment_App

Remember to connect to Firebase before run the app;

Go to Authentication and Firestore to look for account for login or edit, or you can just make one if you want;

Done:;
Custom login;
Custom registration;
Forget Password;
Profile;
Change Password;
Review App;
Contact Us;
About Us;
Logout;

Almost Done:;
Setting (dark theme, notification);
EditProfile (still stuck at profile picture, can upload to storage but cannot create a field in firestore);
Google sign in (thinking just drop it since we already have custom login and registration);

Just have a page:;
Dashboard;

At least the flow has no problem (for demo), can't guarantee for stress test)
