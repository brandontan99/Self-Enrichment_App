# Self-Enrichment_App

Please go to tool - firebase and connect to auth, realtime db and storage before run the app

For now only has Login, Register, Profile, Edit Profile, and Logout

Only success action has tested, failed actions for each activity have not completed yet (haven't added)

For Login, there are two types of login, custom login and google sign in
custom login can check at firebase for the dummy email and password (at realtime database) or just make a new one at register page.
google sign in I did make it but nothing pop out when I click it (at my side). It seem like there is some fingerprint issue according to my searching (I'm not really sure)
Do help me take a look on it if possible!!!

Profile picture still havent fix yet, I can upload the picture to firebase storage but then it cannot save it at realtime database. (still fixing)

Forget Password, Settings, Review App, Contact Us, About Us design already completed but I didnt upload yet, will upload later.
